# Attribute Gap API

This page describes how to use the attribute based gap API to add gaps between elements inside a flex container.

## Configuration

The gap selectors are customisable and need to be included using the provided mixin:

```scss
@include fx.gap-attribute-selectors(1, 16, px em, $includeResponsiveApi);
```

There you can decide which sizes and units you want selectors to be generated for and whether to include selectors for the responsive API or not.

The above example generates selectors for all sizes from 1 to 16 `px` and `em`.

## `data-layout-gap` attribute

### Values

Value format:  "`<number><unit>`".

With `<number>` being a number that is included in your generated selectors and `<unit>` being a unit you chose the selectors to be generated for.

### Example

```html
<div data-layout="row reverse"
     data-layout-align="start center"
<!-- highlight-next-line -->
	 data-layout-gap="4px">
    <span>One</span>
    <span>Two</span>
    <span>Three</span>
</div>
```
