# Getting Started

## Installation

Add the library to your project's `package.json`:

```bash
npm i -s css-fx-layout
```

Then use the provided mixins in your main stylesheet to include the css-fx-layout selectors. You can choose between using CSS classes
or HTML data attributes (or, while not recommended, use both). If you want to use the layout-gap functionality you can customise which selectors
are going to be generated by providing the start, end and unit as shown in the example below.

css-fx-layout includes a responsive API which is not included per default. If you want to use the responsive API please set the corresponding parameter of the
mixins to `true` as shown in the examples below.

:::tip

You should customize the included mixins using their parameters. If you don't need the functionality provided by a mixin and the selectors it generates you can
simply omit it. Only pick what you need to keep your code base small.

### Using attributes

````scss
@use "css-fx-layout" as fx;

// If you want to include the responsive API selectors
$includeResponsiveApi: true;

// If you choose to use attribute selectors:
@include fx.attribute-selectors($includeResponsiveApi);
@include fx.gap-attribute-selectors(1, 16, 1, px em, $includeResponsiveApi);
@include fx.gap-attribute-selectors-from-list(32 48, px em, $includeResponsiveApi);
@include fx.flex-size-attribute-selectors(5, 100, 5, $includeResponsiveApi);
@include fx.flex-size-attribute-selectors-from-list(33 66, $includeResponsiveApi);

````

### Using CSS classes

````scss
@use "css-fx-layout" as fx;

// If you want to include the responsive API selectors
$includeResponsiveApi: true;

// If you choose to use CSS class selectors:
@include fx.class-selectors($includeResponsiveApi);
@include fx.gap-class-selectors(1, 16, 1, px em, $includeResponsiveApi);
@include fx.gap-class-selectors-from-list(32 48, px em, $includeResponsiveApi);
@include fx.flex-size-class-selectors(5, 100, 5, $includeResponsiveApi);
@include fx.flex-size-class-selectors-from-list(33 66, $includeResponsiveApi);
