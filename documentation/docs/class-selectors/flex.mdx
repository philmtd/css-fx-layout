# Flex API

This page describes how to use the class based flex API.

## Selectors

The flex API consists of classes with the following names and their resulting CSS:

| Selector           | CSS                 |
|--------------------|---------------------|
| `fx-flex`          | `flex: 1 1 0;`      |
| `fx-flex-auto`     | `flex-basis: 100%;` |
| `fx-flex-grow`     | `flex: 1 1 100%;`   |
| `fx-flex-initial`  | `flex: 0 1 auto;`   |
| `fx-flex-none`     | `flex: 0 0 auto;`   |
| `fx-flex-nogrow`   | `flex: 0 1 auto;`   |
| `fx-flex-noshrink` | `flex: 1 0 auto;`   |

## Support for flex sizes

Additionally, you can generate flex size selectors using the mixins as shown in the following example. They will extend the `fx-flex` classes
with the following schema

| Selector            | CSS                    |
|---------------------|------------------------|
| `fx-flex--<number>` | `flex: 1 1 <number>%;` |
| e.g. `fx-flex--30`  | `flex: 1 1 30%;`       |

This can be used to give elements a width with the percentage of the numerical value in relation to their flex container.

```scss
@include fx.flex-size-class-selectors;
@include fx.flex-size-class-selectors-from-list(33 66);
```

The mixins can be configured with parameters to generate only the selectors you need. The first mixin can generate a range of selectors with a configurable
start and end and a given increment.

The second mixin will generate only selectors for the numbers passed as the first argument.

Both mixins can generate selectors for the responsive API (e.g. `fx-flex--50--gt-sm`)
