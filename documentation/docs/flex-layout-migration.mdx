# 🧭 Migration from Angular Flex-Layout

If you consider migrating to css-fx-layout from Angular Flex-Layout be sure to know this library's limitations.
Not every feature of Flex-Layout is available but almost all popular features should be and some missing features can be
easily replaced.

As the migration is easier when you choose to use css-fx-layout with attribute selectors, this guide only focuses on this migration.

## Limitations

Let's start with what is missing in css-fx-layout in comparison with Angular Flex-Layout:

* no JavaScript API
* no general support for Angular expression bindings
* no alternative for `fxFlex` with numerical units other than percent
* the alternatives for `fxFlexAlign` only support `start`, `center`, `end`, `baseline` and `stretch`
* no grid functionality
* no alternative for `fxFlexOrder`
* no alternative for `fxFlexOffset`
* no custom breakpoints
* the alternative to `fxShow` only supports the responsive API and does not work the same way it does in Flex-Layout

:::warning Migrate away from `fxShow` / `data-show`

When moving to css-fx-layout it is recommended to migrate all elements using `fxShow` with more than one media size or in combination with `fxHide` to multiple `data-hide` attributes.
css-fx-layout is not a JavaScript powered library and cannot make the selectors work the same smart way they do in Angular Flex-Layout. Ignoring this advice and
keeping multiple `data-show` attributes on your elements or trying to combine them with `data-hide` will very likely not result in what you want!

:::

There *may* be more differences in the details but these are the most obvious and big ones.

## Migration

:::info

css-fx-layout generates some selectors only for the defined numerical values, for example the gap or flex selectors.
Make sure to customise the parameters of the mixins in a way that generates all selectors you need in your project.

:::

Now that we got this out of the way let's migrate. Most of it should be possible to do with some smart
finds and replaces in your code using regular expressions.

There is a migration script available which will try to do most of it automatically. You can call it like this:

```bash
npx css-fx-layout migrate [path/to/src]
```

| Flex-Layout selector       | Regex search               | Regex replace           |
|----------------------------|----------------------------|-------------------------|
| `fxLayout`                 | `fxLayout=`                | `data-layout=`          |
| `fxLayout` responsive      | `fxLayout\.([\w-]+)=`      | `data-layout-$1=`       |
| `fxLayoutAlign`            | `fxLayoutAlign=`           | `data-layout-align=`    |
| `fxLayoutAlign` responsive | `fxLayoutAlign\.([\w-]+)=` | `data-layout-align-$1=` |
| `fxFlex`                   | `fxFlex=`                  | `data-flex=`            |
| `fxFlex` responsive        | `fxFlex\.([\w-]+)=`        | `data-flex-$1=`         |
| `fxLayoutGap`              | `fxLayoutGap=`             | `data-layout-gap=`      |
| `fxLayoutGap` responsive   | `fxLayoutGap\.([\w-]+)=`   | `data-layout-gap-$1=`   |
| `fxHide` responsive        | `fxHide\.([\w-]+)`         | `data-hide-$1`          |
| `fxShow` responsive        | `fxShow\.([\w-]+)`         | `data-show-$1`          |
| `fxFlexFill`               | `fxFlexFill`               | `data-flex-fill`        |
| `fxFlexFill` responsive    | `fxFlexFill\.([\w-]+)`     | `data-flex-fill-$1`     |

Additionally:
* you need to replace all occurrences of `row-reverse` and `column-reverse` with `row reverse` or `column reverse`
* you should change your code to follow the advice regarding `data-show` from the warning box above

This should get the migration of all available features done. In many projects, even larger ones, this can already be 80-100% of the work required
to move away from Angular Flex-Layout.
