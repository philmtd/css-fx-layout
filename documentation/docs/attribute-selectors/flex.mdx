# Flex API

This page describes how to use the attribute based flex API.

## `data-fx-flex` attribute

The flex API consists of one attribute selector with the following available values and their resulting CSS:

| Value        | CSS                 |
|--------------|---------------------|
| `<no value>` | `flex: 1 1 0;`      |
| `auto`       | `flex-basis: 100%;` |
| `grow`       | `flex: 1 1 100%;`   |
| `initial`    | `flex: 0 1 auto;`   |
| `none`       | `flex: 0 0 auto;`   |
| `nogrow`     | `flex: 0 1 auto;`   |
| `noshrink`   | `flex: 1 0 auto;`   |

## Support for flex sizes

Additionally, you can generate flex size selectors using the mixins as shown in the following example. They will extend the `data-fx-flex` attribute
with numerical values, for example:

| Selector                  | CSS                    |
|---------------------------|------------------------|
| `data-fx-flex="<number>"` | `flex: 1 1 <number>%;` |
| e.g. `data-fx-flex="30"`  | `flex: 1 1 30%;`       |

This can be used to give elements a width with the percentage of the numerical value in relation to their flex container.

```scss
@include fx.flex-size-attribute-selectors;
@include fx.flex-size-attribute-selectors-from-list(33 66);
```

The mixins can be configured with parameters to generate only the selectors you need. The first mixin can generate a range of selectors with a configurable
start and end and a given increment.

The second mixin will generate only selectors for the numbers passed as the first argument.

Both mixins can generate selectors for the responsive API (e.g. `data-fx-flex-gt-sm="50"`)
